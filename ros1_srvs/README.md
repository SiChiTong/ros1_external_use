# Overview

This directory demonstrates how to use both pre-existing and custom ROS
service structures in C++ and Python via CMake and make.

For more information, see `ros1_msgs/README.md`. This directory is a copy of
that one, with the messages converted to services and then a handful of changes
made. The build and run procedure is the same as for `ros1_msgs`.
